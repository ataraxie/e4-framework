# E4 - The enjoyable performance testing framework

E4 is intended for performance and scale testing web applications with arbitrarily many browser agents running on arbitrarily many "worker nodes" around the globe.

This project is work in progress; as is the documentation. We promise it will grow. Because E4 will grow beyond any expectation.
